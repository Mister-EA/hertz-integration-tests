## EIP-3198 Tests

The goal of these tests is to test the behavior of the `BaseFee.sol` contract under `contracts/` . The tests use te `BaseFee.json` file
which contains both the bytecode and the ABI of the compiled contract. 

If you want to compile the contract yourself and produce the `BaseFee.json` file then run `bash compile_contract.sh`.
